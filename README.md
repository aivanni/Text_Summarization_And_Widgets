We made a project on text summarization. We explored different algorithms for text summarization in the Extractive Summarization and Abstractive Summarization domains.

We wanted to make a tangible end to end solution to our project. We wanted a viable UI for our algorithms through which the user could interact with the backend.
For this we integrated widgets with the jupyter notebook.
The Widget enables the user to get a holistic view of the project, by asking for user input and generating the output. 
The widget takes three parameters as input:
* The type of algorithm the user wants to use for text summarization
* The URL of the Wikipedia page whose text needs to be summarized
* The shrink ratio
The user enters these three inputs and hits the RUN button.
The algorithm gets called from the backend and the output is generated based on the shrink ratio.
